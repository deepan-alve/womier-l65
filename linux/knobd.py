knobd - Womier L65 knob daemon (Linux, tested target: GNOME Wayland).

Turns the volume knob into a context-aware media / scrub / brightness dial.
No keyboard firmware change needed - it just intercepts the knob's evdev events
and re-dispatches them based on gestures + the Left-Shift modifier.

GESTURE MAP  (Left-Shift / Left-Ctrl / Left-Alt = modifiers)
  rotate                -> volume up/down            (accelerates when spun fast)
  Shift + rotate        -> scrub / seek media        (nothing if no player)
  Ctrl  + rotate        -> laptop screen brightness  (native OSD, see bright())
  Alt   + rotate        -> summon the voice assistant (either direction)
                           Publishes MQTT only; Home Assistant decides what it
                           does. Debounced to one trigger per ASSIST_COOLDOWN,
                           since one flick emits several detents.
  press once            -> play/pause  (mute if nothing is playing)
  Shift + press once    -> mute (always)
  double tap            -> next track
  Shift + double tap    -> previous track
  triple tap            -> next software profile     (see APP_PROFILES)
  long press            -> toggle key lighting: dim dark green <-> off
                           (see LIGHTING_PRESETS). Stand-in for Fn+Space, whose
                           bright-white mode lives in firmware and never reaches
                           the host.

Why scrub is on Shift rather than hold+rotate:
  The knob's consumer HID report (id 2) is a SINGLE 16-bit usage slot - mute and
  both rotation usages compete for it, so rotating while the knob is held evicts
  the press and the kernel sees a release. Hold+rotate can therefore never be
  detected, and seeking lives on Shift instead.

REQUIRES
  python-evdev                         (pip install evdev  /  distro python3-evdev)
  wpctl (PipeWire) OR pactl OR amixer  -> volume
  playerctl                            -> media control + scrub
  brightnessctl                        -> laptop backlight
  notify-send                          -> on-screen feedback (optional)

The user must be able to read AND grab /dev/input/event* (usually: be in the
'input' group, then re-login). See the setup notes printed by `--help-setup`.

# FF FF FF. It is handled inside the keyboard (Fn-layer entry 07 00 00 12) and
# sends nothing to the host, so it cannot be intercepted here. Until the firmware
# patch in firmware/README.md is flashed, the long press is the dim-green switch.
#
# Dim green is solid colour (fixed_on) pointed at palette slot 0, which holds a
# dark RGB rather than green at a low brightness level: level 1 of 4 is still
# bright, a raw 00 18 00 is not. The palette is set ONCE, out of band:
#     l65ctl.py colors --rgb 001800 --effect fixed_on --slot 0
# because it is ~35 radio packets and the keyboard dozes mid-write over the
# dongle; the toggle below is only the 128-byte config block.

# NOTE: these write the config block (and the palette) to flash (0xC600, 512-byte
# sector). Fine at long-press frequency, but never wire them to anything that can
# fire rapidly. The RAM-only path is `l65ctl.py frame` (wired only).
